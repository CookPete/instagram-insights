A simple React app to generate interesting stats about your Instagram profile.

See a [live demo](http://cookpete.com/instagram)

Uses my [fork](https://github.com/CookPete/react-transform-boilerplate) of [react-transform-boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-boilerplate)

## Redundancy Notice

Note that since the Instagram API has changed to force all non-approved apps to [sandbox mode](https://www.instagram.com/developer/sandbox/), this app becomes rather useless.
